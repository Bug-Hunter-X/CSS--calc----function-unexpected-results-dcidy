To address the issue, ensure that all units within the `calc()` function are consistent.  Consider using a fallback value if the calculation might result in an invalid value.  For instance, instead of `calc(100% - 50px)`, use `min(calc(100% - 50px), 100%)` to prevent the value from exceeding the maximum available width.  Another solution would be to correctly set the parent element's width to enable proper calculation.
